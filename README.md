### Dashboards
- **Dashboard 1**: Employee satisfaction, advocacy, and trend analysis  
- **Dashboard 2**: Compensation vs ratings and industry-level breakdown

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Average overall company rating is ~4.0, but recommend-to-friend rate is ~42%
- Positive ratings do not always translate into strong employee advocacy
- Compensation positively impacts ratings but not always recommendations
- Several high-rating, low-advocacy outliers indicate non-monetary issues
- Industry and regional differences significantly affect employee sentiment

---

## 📈 Types of Analysis
- **Descriptive**: Rating and recommendation distributions
- **Diagnostic**: Factors influencing low advocacy despite high ratings
- **Predictive**: Risks related to engagement and retention
- **Prescriptive**: Actionable recommendations to improve advocacy and branding

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project highlights that employee satisfaction and advocacy are driven by both **monetary and non-monetary factors**.  
While overall ratings provide a surface-level view, recommend-to-friend metrics offer deeper insights into employee trust and loyalty.

The Power BI dashboard enables stakeholders to explore these relationships interactively and supports **data-driven decision-making** for employer branding and employee engagement.
